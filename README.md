# business-processes
A simple software made for organizing (create, review, update) possible processes that a businees need.

To start the back-end (a console app for the moment), you need to run the dotnet project.
Inside the process-back directory, run 'dotnet build' and then 'dotnet run' from the terminal.
Or build and run from Visual Studio (version used: 2022)

To start the front-end (still not integrated with the back-end) simply run the 'index.html' on a browser of your choice.
